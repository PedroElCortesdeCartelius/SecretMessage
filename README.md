SecretMessage is a Python-based utility designed to hide and reveal invisible secret messages within .txt files.
It encrypts your secret message using different encryption methods, such as the Caesar cipher or the Reverse Alphabet cipher, and then makes this encrypted message invisible inside the file.
It can also locate the invisible secret message in the file, convert it back to visible text, and decrypt it.
It keeps your secrets hidden and encrypted where no one can see them.
